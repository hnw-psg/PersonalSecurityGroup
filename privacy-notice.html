                    <p>PSG may need to ask for proof of identification before a request can be processed. PSG will inform the requestor if it needs to verify his/her identity and the documents it requires.</p>

                    <p>PSG will normally respond to a request within a period of 30 days from the date a request is received. In some cases, such as where PSG processes large amounts of the individual’s data, it may respond within 90 days of the date the request is received. PSG will write to the requestor within 30 days of receiving the original request to tell him/her if more time is needed to complete the response to their request.</p>
                                
                    <p>If an EU/EEA or Swiss individual submits a request which is manifestly unfounded or excessive, PSG is not required to comply with the request. Alternatively, PSG can agree to respond but will charge a fee, which will be based on the administrative cost of responding to the request.</p>
